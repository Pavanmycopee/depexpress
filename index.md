HOW CAN I SET UP A BUSINESS WITHOUT INVESTING ANY MONEY?
I asked this question to a successful serial entrepreneur .

He gave me 2 Simple ways-

1. Customers:

Meet with 100 customers, ask them about their challenges.
Make a list of all the common challenges.
Pick one you can solve for them. Go back to the customers, check if they will pay for it. Start with providing them a service.

2. Marketing:

If finding 100 customers is tough to use social media & build your brand.
Try not to spend any money on it. Pick any one platform & focus on it.
If things donâ€™t work move to another platform.
It should take you 100 days to crack your first customer.

Get your first cheque. You have a business now.

Go meet the next 100 customers.

Yes it worked ðŸ™‚
